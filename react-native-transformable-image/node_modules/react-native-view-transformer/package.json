  "readme": "# react-native-view-transformer\n\n A pure JavaScript RN component that makes **ANY** views transformable using gestures like pinch, double tap or pull.\n\n![](Demo/demo.gif)\n\n\n\n## Install\n\n`npm install --save react-native-view-transformer@latest`\n\n## Usage\n\n```\nimport ViewTransformer from 'react-native-view-transformer';\n...\nrender() {\n  return (\n  \t<ViewTransformer>\n\t  //ANY views\n\t</ViewTransformer>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nNow, the wrapped views are transformable!\n\nThis component accepts following props:\n\n* `enableTransform` : false to disable transform gestures. Default is true.\n* `enableScale` : false to disable scale. Default is true.\n* `enableTranslate` : false to disable translateX/Y. Default is true.\n* `maxScale` : a number. Default is 1.\n* `enableResistance`  : true to resist over pan. Defaul is false.\n* `maxOverScrollDistance` : a number used to determine final scroll position triggered by fling. Default is 20.\n* `onViewTransformed` : a callback called when transform changed, receiving current transform object, {scale: xxx, translateX: xxx, translateY: xxx}.\n* `onTransformGestureReleased` : a callback called when the transform gesture is released,  receiving current transform object, {scale: xxx, translateX: xxx, translateY: xxx}. Return true to abort further animations like bounce back.\n\n#### methods\n\n`updateTransform(transform)` : immediately transform this view.\n\n\n\n## Transformable Image\n\nThe most common case is to transform an image, or a photo, which is famous as a ***PhotoView***, or ***ImageViewer***, so I provide a dedicated component [**react-native-transformable-image**](https://github.com/ldn0x7dc/react-native-transformable-image)\n\n\n\n## Application\n\nBesides transforming an image, this component is helpful in implementing transition animations. \n\nFor example, you want to transform a normal size content into a right-bottom floating small window (like the android youtube app). Using this component, you can do as following:\n\n1. Calculate the normal rect and the final rect. A `ViewTransformer.Rect(left, top, right, bottom)` object defines the boundary of a view\n2. Use `ViewTransformer.getTransform(fromRect, toRect)` to get the transform object\n3. Use `updateTransform(transform)` to make the tranform happen( This is immediate, but you can animate it by calculating the intermediate rects and then transform using your own animation loop)\n\n\n\n",
